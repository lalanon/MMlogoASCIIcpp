## Description
A "quick and dirty" brute forse  "MM" logo generator.

By changing the _logoLeters_ constant and recompiling, the number of consecutive "M"s can be changed.
By changing the _solidSymbol_ and _emptySymbol_ constants, different symbols can be used in the rendering.
The logo is being rendered directly to the screen, so no data structures are being used.
